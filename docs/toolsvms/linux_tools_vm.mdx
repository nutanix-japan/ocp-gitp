           # follow prompts 
           # do not specify passphrase
           # once completed run the following command
           
           cat id_rsa.pub
           
           # copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your cloudinit yaml file
           ```
          </details>

        - Paste the following script in the script window once you have access to your ssh key-pair.
